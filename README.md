# LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION


# What is the project about?

This project is my engineering thesis. The project uses the knn algorithm and the OpenCV library. The program takes the input image which is the frontal car and the output image is the same car with the license plate framed. The characters of this plate are listed below the frame.
